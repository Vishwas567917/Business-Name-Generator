# Random Business Name Generator

This repository contains a simple JavaScript script that generates random business names by combining three randomly selected words. It demonstrates basic JavaScript control structures and randomness.

## How It Works

The script generates three random words to form a business name. It uses a random number to decide which word to pick for each position (first, second, and third). The possible outcomes are as follows:

- **First Word:** Can be "Crazy", "Amazing", or "Fire".
- **Second Word:** Can be "Engine", "Foods", or "Garments".
- **Third Word:** Can be "Bros", "Limited", or "Hub".

Based on a random value, the script selects one word from each category and combines them to create a business name.

## Example Output
Crazy Foods Bros
Fire Engine Limited
Amazing Garments Hub

The output can vary depending on the random numbers generated.

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's console (usually with `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + J`).
3. The generated business name will be displayed in the console.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the script or would like to add more word options, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

This script is for entertainment and educational purposes. The generated business names are random and should not be used for actual business purposes without proper due diligence.
